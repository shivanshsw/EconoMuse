# 🌍 EconoMuse

**Understand the impact of economic policies — one decision at a time.**  
An interactive policy simulator + AI advisor that lets you explore how real-world economic decisions shape people’s lives.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**EconoMuse** is a browser-based simulation tool that allows users to experiment with economic policies (like taxes, subsidies, and wages) and see their effects in real-time across different societal groups.

Whether you're a student, a curious thinker, or a future policymaker — EconoMuse helps you *feel* the ripple effects of complex decisions, assisted by an AI that explains everything in simple language.
